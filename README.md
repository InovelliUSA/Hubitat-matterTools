# Hubitat-matterTools
Welcome to the Hubitat-matterTools wiki!

This is a set of Hubitat libraries that expand on the existing hubitat "matter" object methods by allowing designation of endpoints and by supporting child devices. 

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/jvmahon/Hubitat-matterTools/wiki) tab for detailed use instructions.
